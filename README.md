# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing a dataset of transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders, the model identifies potentially fraudulent activities to help mitigate financial losses.

## Features

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling class imbalance using SMOTE
- Model training with various algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `imbalanced-learn`
- colab Notebook for exploratory data analysis

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dalpozz/creditcard-fraud). It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 and is balanced to include both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naveenj11/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
